    </head>

    <body>
        I'm Marissa Carr. I’m an advertising and information management and technology major interested in pursuing a career in data analytics. I have had internships in brand research and email marketing. I am an account strategy director for TNH Advertising Agency, which has led me to improve my leadership and strategical thinking skills. When I am not working, I enjoy watching New Girl or the Office, drawing, or going on walks with my dog. I also love listening to music, especially the Weeknd and Miley Cyrus, and hanging out with my three brothers. I have always enjoyed having such a large family because my brothers are way funnier than me and have kept me entertained all my life.
