        <h2>Work Experience</h2>

        <h3>Account Strategy Director & Team Member / TNH Advertising Agency / Syracuse, NY / August 2019 &mdash; Present</h3>
        <p>As Account Strategy Director, I lead a team of 4 strategists to strategically design and conduct interviews and surveys in order to develop insights based on the research. Our clients are local Syracuse businesses, such as XO Taco and Dinosaur BBQ. For more information click <a href="tnh.html">here.</a></p>

        <h3>Research Intern / Sailthru / New York, NY / June 2021 &mdash; September 2021</h3>
        <p>In this position, I examined the websites and email marketing strategies for 106 retail brands. I compared these brands to determine how closely they aligned to marketing and personalization best practices. My research was used to create a comprehensive list of the best retail brands with these characteristics for Sailthru to show their retail clients.</p>

        <h3>Strategy & Analytics Intern / Sailthru / New York, NY / January 2021 &mdash; May 2021</h3>
        <p>As a Strategy & Analytics Intern, I researched the subscription business industry to better educate Sailthru’s employees on what email marketing and website personalization tactics they should recommend to clients that fall under this category. This position allowed me to interpret internal email data to create these strategies and best practices.</p>

        <h3>Teaching Assistant / Syracuse University / Syracuse, NY / August 2020 &mdash; December 2020</h3>
        <p>I was a teaching assistant for Introduction to Computer Networking course, which was a technical overview of information systems, network software, and hardware technologies. I collaborated with the professor and other 4 teaching assistants to prepare lab assignments for the class of 147 students. I assisted these students with the lab work and class materials, as well as helped prepare them for upcoming exams by hosting review sessions.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <h3>“Predicting Hotel Bookings that Lead to Cancellations” / Fall 2021</h3>
        <p>Using RStudio, I programmed several predictive models and data visualizations with the aim of predicting when a hotel booking would indicate that it would be cancelled. I trained and evaluated models with a variety of statistical modeling techniques, such as decision tree and SVM. For more information click <a href="rproject.html">here.</a></p>

        <h3>“It’s 5 O’clock Somewhere” / Fall 2020</h3>
        <p>I programmed a Python application in which the user would input their mood and the program would return an alcoholic beverage, instructions on how to make it, a song that matched the inputted mood, and the music video of the song. I implemented the IBM Watson Tone Analyzer, Musixmatch, Youtube, and the Cocktail DB APIs. I coded the Tone Analyzer API to examine song lyrics returned by the Musixmatch API.</p>
